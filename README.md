## 📊 Business Intelligence Focus
This project demonstrates how IoT sensor data, AI analytics, and BI dashboards transform healthcare screening into actionable business intelligence for stroke prevention.

## 🎯 Overview
CardioMitra is an innovative stroke prevention system that combines wearable IoT technology with AI analytics and BI dashboards to make stroke screening accessible, affordable, and data-driven. The platform focuses on converting medical sensor data into business intelligence insights for healthcare decision-making.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
**The Invisible Killer: Why Stroke Screening Fails Millions**
- Stroke is a leading cause of death & disability worldwide
- **70% of rural Indians cannot access stroke screening** (WHO, 2024)
- Critical barriers: High cost (>$20,000 machines), urban-only availability, specialist dependency

## 💡 BI-Driven Solution
CardioMitra addresses these challenges through a **data pipeline to insights** approach:
- **IoT Data Collection**: Wearable neckband captures carotid artery data
- **AI Processing**: Real-time plaque detection and risk scoring
- **BI Transformation**: Raw data → Cleaned data → KPIs → Dashboards → Decisions
